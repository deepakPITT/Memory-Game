MEMORY GAME DESCRIPTION 
The game includes a 4 by 4 grid of tiles. Once the player clicks on first tile, the tile should be flipped and stay flipped to show the image of the tile.
 Then the player can click on another tile, if the tile matches the flipped one, it stays flipped; if it doesn't match, then it should be flipped back after a delay to allow the user to see the images.
The game should keep track of time and number of clicks  and show the result once all the tiles have been flipped correctly. Clicking on "Play" button in the middle of the game should start a new game.
